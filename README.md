TableFilter is a set of Swing components to support user-driven filtering on table.

Full documentation is included in the home page at https://coderazzi.net/tablefilter

**This is the repository holding a version specific for Java 5. The generic library is hosted at https://github.com/coderazzi/tablefilter-swing**

Note that this Java 5 version does not have the same capabilities as the generic version.

The output (binaries) can be used directly in maven, as they are hosted in the central repository at https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/net/coderazzi/tablefilter-swing-java5/
